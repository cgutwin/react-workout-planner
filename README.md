# react-workout-planner
### A simple workout planner made using React and React Native.

The final assignment for a course focused around using ReactJS and React Native to learn how frameworks like this work. We had three hours to complete the web and mobile versions of the app, functionality only. Styling wasn't in the scope.

Was marked as follows:  

+ /4 <Start>
+ /4 <Name>
+ /8 <Age>
+ /4 <Exercise>
+ /3 <Workout>
+ /2 <Edit>
+ /4 Mobile 


This example shows all points met, except the workout isn't editable.


## Intsall and Run

```
cd directory
npm install
npm start
```
Where directory is either **webapp** or **native**
